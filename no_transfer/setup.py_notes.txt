The `new_password` default plaintext password is 0004
if you want to change it the following process is used to encode and decode the password
    plaintext -> base64 -> int base 10 -> hex

    before running the command it decodes the password from the hex value
    hex -> int base 10 -> base64 -> plaintext

    ob_pw_len is the length of the password in bytes based on the 
    length of the base64 encoded password
